Adulthood is something to fear.

Nothing fundamentally changes when you become an adult. Rather, it's the realization of the immense journey that led you to this moment that make you blink your eyes and say, "oh I'm old now."

Not that 18 is actually a very old age, but it is the age people start swearing way more often. It's a subconscious thing.

Here is Aimee Carty's song.

> "Oh, to be a child again," they said  
> To have a brand new heart and brand new head  
> To find the smallest of all things exciting  
> To find the biggest of all things inviting  
> "Oh, to be a child again," they said  
> At first, I thought it too  
> But now I'm thinking  
> And I don't know if I do  
> 'cause I'm just thinking  
> That maybe we don't miss being younger  
> Maybe we just miss the wonder  
> We miss the point of view  
> 
> But we can have it too  
> If we really try  
> All you have to do  
> Is open your eyes  
> The world is just the same  
> As it has always been  
> The beauty is alive  
> It's eager to be seen  
> So don't dismiss the colours  
> Don't dismiss the sounds  
> Find comfort in the rain  
> Find magic in the clouds  
> As we get older  
> We fall into a spell  
> To blame it on the world and not to look inside ourselves  
> 
> "Oh to be a child again," they said  
> Look at them, they have no fears at all  
> They'll chase their dreams  
> They'll get up if they fall  
> But I think the main component  
> It's not bravery  
> I think it's just living in the moment  
> They don't get caught up in the future  
> Or caught up in the past  
> Or caught up thinking about the things they don't already have  
> When you're a child  
> You don't wish your life away  
> Or long for other times that isn't now, that's not today

What makes 18 a landmark? Perhaps, it has to do with the brain. Grey matter reduction makes the brain less able to learn, but more efficient. Well that explains some things.

Yet there's no exact age or moment in development that we can point to as having reached full maturity. If there's no consensus on exactly when we reach maturity, when do we actually become adults? Shannon Odell shares how scientists define adulthood using stages of brain development.
