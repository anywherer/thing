An advertisement is a notice or announcement in a public medium promoting something. At least, that's one definition.



to promote is to support or encourage. i guess, when we really think about it, advertisements are just normal things, anything that has a purpose to support or encourage


The idea of ads being manipulative is so scary. but it's true - the digital age saw the rise of personalized, targeted ads, which were very effective, I must say.

Why would an advertisement be horrible? Well it is all about money, and using whatever means possible to get money. Typical.


Hopefully, in the distant future we'll look at our history through ads, and see the transition from horrible ads to helpful ads.
