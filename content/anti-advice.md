Anti-advice is giving people bad advice. It seems to work well.

Anti-advice is not common. But when we find anti-advice, we are suddenly enlightened by the truth.

Someone telling you to do something but you want to do the opposite, such is a part of psychology.

But it's more than that. It's fundamentally different to avoid some anti-advice, versus to follow advice. Losses are more important than wins.
