https://www.ted.com/talks/ricardo_semler_how_to_run_a_company_with_almost_no_rules + Ricardo Semler: How to run a company with (almost) no rules | TED Talk + What if your job didn't control your life? Brazilian CEO Ricardo Semler practices a radical form of corporate democracy, rethinking everything from board meetings to how workers report their vacation days (they don't have to). It's a vision that rewards the wisdom of workers, promotes work-life balance â€” and leads to some deep insight on what work, and life, is really all about. Bonus question: What if schools were like this too?
