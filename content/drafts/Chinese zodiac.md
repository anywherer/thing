The Chinese zodiac is a 12-year cycle labeled with animals.
Not to be confused with the Greco-Roman zodiac, which are related to constellations with the signs divided into 12 months.

Over thousands of years, the Chinese zodiac has affected people's major decisions, such as naming, marriage, giving birth and attitude towards each other.


Are Chinese zodiac signs trustable?

To answer the question, statistically speaking, the evidence of their usefulness is significant. In simple terms, there is scientific evidence that zodiac signs influence the probabilities of one's personality and actions to varying extents.

Revealing your zodiac sign is a way of revealing your age. But there's lots more. You are also being evaluated. Judgments are being made about your fortune or misfortune, your personality, career prospects and how you will do in a given year. If you share you and your partner's animal signs, they will paint a picture in their mind about your private life. Maybe you don't believe in the Chinese zodiac. As a quarter of the world population is influenced by it, you'd be wise to do something about that.



The theory behind the Chinese zodiac is complicated. The Chinese ancestors constructed a very complicated theoretical framework based on yin and yang, the five
elements and the 12 zodiac animals.

In Western astrology, it's a constellation determined by when your birthday falls in the calendar. But according to the Chinese zodiac (生肖), it's your shuxiang, meaning the animal assigned to your birth year. And of the many myths explaining these animal signs and their arrangement, the most enduring one is that of The Great Race. Megan Campisi and Pen-Pen Chen recount this classic myth.
