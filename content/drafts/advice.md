people give advice.

the thing about advice is though, they tend to be way shorter than they need to be.

all those articles about advice this, advice that... 

though i admit, the advice are helpful.

sometimes they are symbolic, ambiguous statements that could mean something solid if you think hard enough

sometimes they are bits and pieces of things that we find over the years.

sometimes, we call these, wisdom.
