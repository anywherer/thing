be kind to yourself first. 

https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_harris_the_benefits_of_not_being_a_jerk_to_yourself + Dan Harris: The benefits of not being a jerk to yourself | TED Talk + After more than two decades as an anchor for ABC News, an on-air panic attack sent Dan Harris's life in a new direction: he became a dedicated meditator and, to some, even a guru. But then an anonymous survey of his family, friends and colleagues turned up some brutal feedback -- he was still kind of a jerk. In a wise, funny talk, he shares his years-long quest to improve his relationships with everyone (starting with himself) and explains the science behind loving-kindness meditation, and how it can boost your resiliency, quiet your inner critic and simply make you more pleasant to be around.
