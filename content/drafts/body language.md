What if, your body language changes who you are?

This experiment[^1] suggests that different poses actually have a real impact on your hormone levels, that is testosterone and cortisol, and therefore influencing your thoughts.

We knew that you control your body langauge, but it's also true the other way around.

> So when I tell people about this, that our bodies change our minds and our minds can change our behavior, and our behavior can change our outcomes, they say to me, "It feels fake." Right? So I said, fake it till you make it. It's not me. I don't want to get there and then still feel like a fraud. I don't want to feel like an impostor. I don't want to get there only to feel like I'm not supposed to be here. And that really resonated with me, because I want to tell you a little story about being an impostor and feeling like I'm not supposed to be here.[^1]

Fake it until you make it? I suppose intuitively it does have a lot of positive effects.
