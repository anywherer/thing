Ted talkes are known for their comedy.

https://www.ted.com/talks/pardis_parker_i_m_terrified_of_wanting_to_be_a_billionaire + Negin Farsad: A highly scientific taxonomy of haters | TED Talk + TED Fellow Negin Farsad weaves comedy and social commentary to cleverly undercut stereotypes of her culture. In this uproarious talk/stand-up hybrid, Farsad speaks on her documentary, The Muslims Are Coming!, narrates her fight with the MTA in New York and offers a detailed breakdown of the different types of haters she's encountered in her work. "Comedy is one of our best weapons," she says. "We've tried a lot of approaches to social justice, like war and competitive ice dancing -- but a lot of things are still kind of awful. I think it's time we try and tell a really good poop joke."
