We rely on the brain's processing of information and our experience of that processing.

That experience is what we call consciousness.

This consciousness is not only of the external world but also of our internal selves.

It may be that consciousness is the brain's incomplete picture of its own activity.

Consciousness never tries to capture much information, just enough that you can make decisions and do things.


Now here is the dictionary definition, because I ws curious.

consciousness
noun
- the knowledge of something in one's inner self, or inward awareness of an external object
- the state or activity of sensation, emotion, volition, or thought
- the total amount of perception one has at a given moment
- waking life, as in what one returns to after sleep, trance or unconsciousness
- the part of your mind that is easily available to you

Graziano: What is consciousness? | TED Talk + Patient P.S. suffered a stroke that damaged the right side of her brain, leaving her unaware of everything on her left side. If someone threw a ball at her left side, she might duck. But she wouldn't have awareness of the ball or know why she ducked. Where does consciousness come from? Michael Graziano explores the question that has vexed scientists and philosophers for centuries. [Directed by TED-Ed, narrated by Addison Anderson].
