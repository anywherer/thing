how can you be generous and how can generosity be infectious?

in this new era, the rules of what we hold on to and what we give away have fundamentally changed.

take a risk
give what you can
and be amazed at what happens next.



we are wired to respond to generosity with generosity?

the difference between infectious and not is quite small.


if we can spark imaginatio and hears, it will increase generosity.

generosity is affected by emotion, creativty, and courage.
