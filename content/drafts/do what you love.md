> You actually have to do what you love and make many rapid changes on a consistent basis while maintaining the daily habit. You have to be humble enough to get out of your own way and have your assumptions challenged, and ideally, freaking demolished with a nuclear bomb.
> 
> The people who do what they love aren’t the smartest people in the room.
> 
> They’re the ones who experiment like mad scientists and force their way into rooms full of successful people they don’t belong in.[^thing]


> How much are you supposed to like what you do? Unless you know that, you don't know when to stop searching. And if, like most people, you underestimate it, you'll tend to stop searching too early. You'll end up doing something chosen for you by your parents, or the desire to make money, or prestige — or sheer inertia.[^thing2]


> Constraints give your life shape. Remove them and most people have no idea what to do: look at what happens to those who win lotteries or inherit money. Much as everyone thinks they want financial security, the happiest people are not those who have it, but those who like what they do. So a plan that promises freedom at the expense of knowing what to do with it may not be as good as it seems.[^thing2]


> "Always produce" is also a heuristic for finding the work you love. If you subject yourself to that constraint, it will automatically push you away from things you think you're supposed to work on, toward things you actually like. "Always produce" will discover your life's work the way water, with the aid of gravity, finds the hole in your roof.[^thing2]
