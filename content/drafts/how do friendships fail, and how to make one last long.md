sustaining your friendships is especially important because [[forming new friendships take a lot of time]].

think about all your friends who you don't talk to anymore! why has this happened?

why is it so difficult to prevent friends from falling apart?

friendships often dissolve because of a lack of opporunity to meet and connect.

after a long time without talking, some friendships may feel like they are hanging on by a thread. your memories of the time spent with your friend fade.

apparently, the size of our friendship group actually stays pretty stable, at about 20 to 30 friends. however, half of your friends get replaced by new ones every 7 years.


friendships that have special meanings to both sides will persist easily because you will always be happy to see each other. ones that are quite casual will fade over time

the friendships that fade need a cause, and excuse if you will, so that you can connect and become close.

are we doomed because we don't get to spend time with some of our friends anymore? the distance gets further and further if you're not meeting with them. this is a natural thing that happens.

however, there are some friendships that does not fade no matter the time or the distance. do you have someone you very rarely speak to but feel so happy every time you see them? it's an interesting thing.
