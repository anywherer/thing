> But anyway, not only does this person take on special meaning, you focus your attention on them. You aggrandize them. But you have
> intense energy. As one Polynesian said, "I felt like jumping in the sky." You're up all night. You're walking till dawn. You feel intense elation
> when things are going well; mood swings into horrible despair when things are going poorly. Real dependence on this person. As one
> businessman in New York said to me, "Anything she liked, I liked." Simple. Romantic love is very simple.
> 
> You become extremely sexually possessive. You know, if you're just sleeping with somebody casually, you don't really care if they're sleeping
> with somebody else. But the moment you fall in love, you become extremely sexually possessive of them. I think there's a Darwinian purpose
> to this. The whole point of this is to pull two people together strongly enough to begin to rear babies as a team.
> 
> But the main characteristics of romantic love are craving: an intense craving to be with a particular person, not just sexually, but emotionally.
> It would be nice to go to bed with them, but you want them to call you on the telephone, to invite you out, etc., to tell you that they love you.
> The other main characteristic is motivation. The motor in the brain begins to crank, and you want this person.
> 
> And last but not least, it is an obsession. Before I put these people in the MRI machine, I would ask them all kinds of questions. But my most
> important question was always the same. It was: "What percentage of the day and night do you think about this person?" And indeed, they
> would say, "All day. All night. I can never stop thinking about him or her."
> 
> I began to realize that romantic love is not an emotion. In fact, I had always thought it was a series of emotions, from very high to very low.
> But actually, it's a drive. It comes from the motor of the mind, the wanting part of the mind, the craving part of the mind. The kind of part of
> the mind when you're reaching for that piece of chocolate, when you want to win that promotion at work. The motor of the brain. It's a drive.
> 
> And in fact, I think it's more powerful than the sex drive. You know, if you ask somebody to go to bed with you, and they say, "No, thank
> you," you certainly don't kill yourself or slip into a clinical depression. But certainly, around the world, people who are rejected in love will kill
> for it. People live for love. They kill for love. They die for love. They have songs, poems, novels, sculptures, paintings, myths, legends. In over
> 175 societies, people have left their evidence of this powerful brain system. I have come to think it's one of the most powerful brain systems
> on Earth for both great joy and great sorrow.
> 
> And I've also come to think that it's one of three basically different brain systems that evolved from mating and reproduction. One is the sex
> drive: the craving for sexual gratification. W.H. Auden called it an "intolerable neural itch," and indeed, that's what it is. It keeps bothering you
> a little bit, like being hungry. The second of these three brain systems is romantic love: that elation, obsession of early love. And the third
> brain system is attachment: that sense of calm and security you can feel for a long-term partner.[^2]
