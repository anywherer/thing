are we more than the sum of our years on this planet?

- coherent. the world needs to be understandable
- purpose. what your life can be and should be. it gives you goals.
- significance. you are more than what you are and you will continue to matter in the future.


> You understand what it means to have even the most glorious achievements and still ask, is this enough? Is this it? Is this all I add up to?[^thing]

not just that relationships provide meaning, being part of a story that is not your own provides meaning.


what is personal achievement? it is easy to see and it is natural to seek them.


meaining is opportunities to participate in other peoples stories

expending emotional energy on something that doesn not make happiness... can pursue meaning

> And that is, you go through the world with all of your brilliance, and I mean that in terms of light, as you go through the world, lighting the world, when you interact with other people and you illuminate them and help them shine more brightly, that's how the world gets illuminated. That's how we bring up the lights. And the world, obviously, desperately needs that. And in return, what you get is meaning, because when we're gone, all of the accomplishments will mean nothing. The only thing that will be left of you when you're gone -- and we all will be gone eventually -- the only thing will be left of you is the role you played in other people's stories, what you leave with other people, how that reverberates through time. And that is a beautiful thing, and I wish all of that for you.[^thing]
