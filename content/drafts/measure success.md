we all know that we constantly measure success.




> The metrics of success which we choose lead to long-term, real-life consequences, and they determine everything. I’m not famous, but I improve people’s lives. To me, that makes me successful. And sometimes I even struggle to keep that in mind. You may be single and alone right now, but you can also be happy and proud of yourself. That makes you successful. We must take care in choosing the way in which we measure success because the metrics we choose will determine all of our actions and beliefs. And often these metrics are based on our values.[^measureyourlife]
