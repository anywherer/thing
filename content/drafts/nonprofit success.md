In Africa, we have a proverb which states that if you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. But what happens when trying to solve a problem like increasing financial access requires that you go both fast and far? I believe that we need to do development differently. We need to include the profit motive and for-profit approaches into the way that we do development.
