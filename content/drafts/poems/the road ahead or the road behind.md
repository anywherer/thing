> Sometimes I think the fates must grin as we denounce them and insist,  
> The only reason we can’t win is the fates themselves have missed.  
> Yet, there lives on the ancient claim – we win or lose within ourselves,  
> The shining trophies on our shelves can never win tomorrow’s game.  
> So you and I know deeper down there is a chance to win the crown,  
> But when we fail to give our best, we simply haven’t met the test  
> Of giving all and saving none until the game is really won.  
> Of showing what is meant by grit, of fighting on when others quit,  
> Of playing through not letting up, it’s bearing down that wins the cup.  
> Of taking it and taking more until we gain the winning score,  
> Of dreaming there’s a goal ahead, of hoping when our dreams are dead,  
> Of praying when our hopes have fled. Yet, losing, not afraid to fall,  
> If bravely we have given all, for who can ask more of a man  
> than giving all within his span, it seems to me, is not so far from – Victory.  
> And so the fates are seldom wrong, no matter how they twist and wind,  
> It’s you and I who make our fates, we open up or close the gates,  
> On the Road Ahead or the Road Behind.
