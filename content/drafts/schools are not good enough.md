We look at schools and complaina bout how miserably bad many school are.

Many schools are very lousy today. It is 2025! But still so terrible!

Why haven't we allowed innovation to happen?


Maybe schools are the same as banks and everything else. Why don't we just make them better? Why do the schools not care about the customers enough?

Today, as educators, we need to do better. We need to spread all the best information we can. Critical thinking and learning abilities are so important and yet we don't have good education.

Enough is enough! | TED Talk + Why, why, why does our education system look so similar to the way it did 50 years ago? Millions of students were failing then, as they are now -- and it’s because we’re clinging to a business model that clearly doesn’t work. Education advocate Geoffrey Canada dares the system to look at the data, think about the customers and make systematic shifts in order to help greater numbers of kids excel.
