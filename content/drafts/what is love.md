the definition of love has been very broad throughout time...


what is love? a verb? a noun? a truth? a neurological phenomenon?

it's everything. it's all you need. it's all there is!

love is actually the most thought about thing in ALL of human history.

despite centuries of obsession, it still overwhelms us to this day.

it's a mystery, a magical emotion, 


if love is a thing we can define, how can it mean so many contradictory ideas?


love might be a construct, contructed from our experiences and feelings and culture.
