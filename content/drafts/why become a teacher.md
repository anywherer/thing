> There sits a statesman, strong, unbiased, wise; another Daniel Webster, silver-tongued.
> A doctor sits beside him, whose quick, steady hand may mend a bone, or stem the life-blood's flow.

> And later I may say, I knew him once... but then he was a boy.
> They ask me why I teach, and I reply, "Where could I find such splendid company?"[^1]
