The eight factors of love is quite a nice study about the "ingredients" for love.
It's a really important thing to discuss.

Sadly, I have forgotten where I found the eight factors of love.

1. Proximity
2. Physical Attractiveness
3. Similarity
4. Affect (i.e. our initial feelings upon meeting someone)
5. Responsiveness
6. Reciprocal liking
7. Self-disclosure (i.e. sharing of personal information)
8. Arousal
