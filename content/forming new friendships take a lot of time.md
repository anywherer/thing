you have to spend 40 to 60 hours of time with someone for you to be casual friends instead of acquaintances. they upgrade to a real friend at 80 to 100 hours. and get elevated to best friend after you spend 200 hours of time together.


all these numbers may be crazy, but statistics is true. quality time spent together means more personal connections.

stress on quality time. friendships require you to actually have productive conversations that make you feel a connection.
