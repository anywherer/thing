Hi world,

I have no idea what you're doing.

You build complicated things in years, and destroy them in days.

You crave understanding, and build walls around your hearts.

You weave webs of connection, and leave loneliness in the spaces between.

You choose the path of least resistance, and waste your potential.

You chase tomorrow, and throw away today.

But do you know what you're doing?
