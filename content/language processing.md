Abstract - Your brain always processes language for your senses and feelings. Sometimes you have thoughts that appear as voices speaking to you, and they are noisy enough to distract you from the peace you wanted.

Once of those continuously happening programs that run in your brain is your language processing thing.


Fun fact, it influences you in many ways, how things are tagged with connotations, how things are simplified into a one-sided perspective view...

We know that things are stored as pieces in your brain.

And most times we sense things, they first went through language processing, and then was given to you.


figure: how language is not beautiful enough

Do you see the problem here?


Of course, it's just a rough example.

But don't you realize, seeing things as.what they really are is important!

You don't need to 


Ok well, that's not the only problem.

Look, what i'm trying to say here is that

This is what I find in myself - voices that keep commenting on everything. It's not good.

But it's not that they are annoying. They are helpful. They are my thoughts, so to speak, but they are so loud.

Much like myself, they cannot keep their thoughts to themselves, can they?


so i figured to myself, 


maybe have a little think about it?

the world does not need to be defined by language, you know.
