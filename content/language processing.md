Your brain always processes language for your senses and feelings. Sometimes you have thoughts that appear as voices speaking to you, and they are noisy enough to distract you from the peace you wanted.

Once of those continuously happening programs that run in your brain is your language processing thing.


Fun fact, it influences you in many ways, how things are tagged with connotations, how things are simplified into a one-sided perspective view...

We know that things are stored as pieces in your brain.

And most times we sense things, they first went through language processing, and then was given to you.

Do you see the problem here?


Of course, it's just a rough example.

But don't you realize, seeing things as.what they really are is important!

You don't need to always comment on things using language, do you? But everything in our thoughts revolve around language.



My thoughts need voices to keep commenting on everything. It's not good.

But it's not that they are annoying. They are helpful. But they are loud and slow.


Much like myself, the voices in my head cannot keep their thoughts to themselves, can they?
