I swear, it's so annoying!

To think, I had to move into a meatbag made of trillions of cells.

There wasn't any documentation either. I was left alone trying to figure everything out.

I learned that I think things, my body does them.

I realized that when the body is hurt, I am burt too. When my body is depressed, I am depressed too.

My body became part of me.

And then I know people who study the body's functions. They find the body to be so incredibly complex that every part of the body has a specialist field.

But I wanted to know. 
Perhaps, a manual can help you understand yours.

*Manual for the human body* - A book on your body. Work in progress.
