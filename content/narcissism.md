Taken to the extreme, this behavior is classified as a psychological disorder called narcissistic personality disorder. It affects one to two
percent of the population, more commonly men. It is also a diagnosis reserved for adults. Young people, especially children, can be very
self-centered, but this might just be a normal part of development. The fifth edition of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual describes several traits associated with narcissistic personality disorder. They include a grandiose view of oneself,
problems with empathy, a sense of entitlement, and a need for admiration or attention. What makes these trait a true personality disorder is
that they take over people's lives and cause significant problems. Imagine that instead of caring for your spouse or children, you used them
as a source of attention or admiration. Or imagine that instead of seeking constructive feedback about your performance, you instead told
everyone who tried to help you that they were wrong

So what causes narcissism? Twin studies show a strong genetic component, although we don't know which genes are involved. But
environment matters, too. Parents who put their child on a pedestal can foster grandiose narcissism. And cold, controlling parents can
contribute to vulnerable narcissism.

Narcissism also seems to be higher in cultures that value individuality and self-promotion.
