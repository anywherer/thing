Sometimes I speak to my own soul
And it makes me cry
ow there is finally someone who understands me
And can have a deep conversation with me.

It's really sad
But I know myself very well
And I guess
I can heal my own trauma.

It's true, isn't it? At the end of the day, the relationship we have with ourselves is the most enduring and significant one.

We're the only constant throughout our lives, the one presence that's always there.
