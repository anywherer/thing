> I finally realized today why politics and religion yield such uniquely useless discussions... Politics, like religion, is a topic where there's no threshold of expertise for expressing an opinion. More generally, you can have a fruitful discussion about a topic only if it doesn't engage the identities of any of the participants. What makes politics and religion such minefields is that they engage so many people's identities.[^thing]
