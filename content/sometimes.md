sometimes we need a way to let our thoughts out.
in a relaxed sort of way, in a way so that you don't sound too harsh and direct

sometimes we need just the right context for writing things.
putting your pen on your paper, and trying so hard to think about what sounds good to write

sometimes, all it takes is a little motivation, a reassurance that your thoughts are free, and you don't have to be afraid to think, to inspire, to create.

perhaps, just one word can encourage you to be brave...

sometimes.
