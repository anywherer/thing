Sometimes is a word of possibility.

Sometimes we need a way to let our thoughts out. In a relaxed sort of way, in a way so that you don't sound too harsh and direct.

We can use this word to help with writer's block. Putting your pen on your paper, and trying so hard to make something good. It doesn't have to be, it just has to be good sometimes.

Sometimes, all it takes is a little motivation, a reassurance that your thoughts are free, and you don't have to be afraid to think, to inspire, to create.

Sometimes it never hurts to try, and it is easy to be brave.

The world is good, sometimes.
