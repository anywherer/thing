Once in a while, you buy strawberries at the farmers' market. Those that sell in nice batches, because the stock needs to clear out soon.

After you take them home, you wash them carefully.
Their bright colors remind you that there is always something special in the world.
Their sweet piquant taste reminds you that you don't have to be successful to enjoy a taste of something you've been walking towards, all your life.

Yes, it's not just strawberries; it's all the little good things in life, maybe some time all to yourself, some time to get your sunlight, your fresh air, your water...

Remember, one strawberry day a week.
