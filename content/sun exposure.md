Abstract - Sun exposure (without sunscreen) is responsible for your mood, immune system, and blood pressure regulation. This radiation is needed for biological processes. The feeling of being comfortable under the sun is the best way to control your sun time.

what's with your sad mood?
you can try go outside... maybe that'll help.

I can't dive into the science behind everything that sunlight does to the human body.

but hey, feelings are sciency enough for me!

if you feel comfortable as the sun hits your skin, you're ok
if not, stop it please!

UV exposure is easy to control :)

stay safe. stay warm.
