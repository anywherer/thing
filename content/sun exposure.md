Sun exposure, without sunscreen, is important for your mood, immune system, and everything healthy and happy. The radiation is needed for biological processes. Your daily sun exposire is easy to control by feeling if it is comfortable under the sun.


We see many people who are happy all day long and always energetic. You may ask yourself, "how can they be outside so much?"

I can't dive into the science behind everything that sunlight does to the human body.

You can try go outside... maybe that'll help.


> Itâ€™s entirely intuitive, he responded. Homo sapiens have been around for 200,000 years. Until the industrial revolution, we lived outside. How did we get through the Neolithic Era without sunscreen? Actually, perfectly well.[^thing]

What about controlling your sun exposure? Feelings are sciency enough, aren't they? Kinda goes like this - if you feel comfortable as the sun hits your skin you're ok; if not stop it please!

Your daily sun exposure is important. It's easy to control. :)

Stay safe. Stay warm.
