A team, by definition, is a stable, bounded group of individuals who are interdependent and work together with a shared goal.

But for many things that we have to do, especially the very difficult things like making a great animated film, you're going to be doing a lot of new things, with people who have different skillsets. You have to get different expertise at different times.

And it appears that teaming across industry boundaries is difficult. For example, software engineers and architects. A team needs the people to communicate, to understand each other, and collectively create endless ideas.

How to overcome the friction between members of a team?

Understanding. Who are your team members and do you understand how they think? Humility. You understand yourself the most, and you know what you can do to help. Curiosity and exploring unknown ideas. It's easy think that you already know about it, so remind yourself to be curious about how the others ideas can inspire you.
Think about the risks and choose the best options.

And once you consider these things, you can overcome the psychological barriers between you and other members of the team.
