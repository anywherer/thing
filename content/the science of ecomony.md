This video says that there are three dials we have in an economy.
Who owns the capital? The government or private ownership?
What gets produced? Does the government decide or do we?
What are the prices? Does the government control prices or does the free market>

Those are the main things controlling the function of economy.

Explore the different types of capitalism and the role it plays in our society. [Directed by Lorenzo Mercanti, AIM Creative Studios, narrated by George Zaidan, music by Andr√© Aires].
