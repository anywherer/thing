The things you own, end up owning you. It's just an ambiguous saying, but the idea is that owning things is a burden to you.

What do you really own in this world anyway?

Is it *your* home, or is it *a* home? What makes it different from other people's homes? Are you attaching yourself to a stationary place on earth?

Worry less about your things. Worry more about you.
