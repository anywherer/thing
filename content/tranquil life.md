Life can be tranquil if you would like it to be.

Or it can be an exciting thing. If you would like to always explore new areas, to always meet new people, to always find new passions, that is a dynamic life.

If you grow up in the same suburb for your entire childhood, until you go to university, after which you settle somewhere, find a job, find things you like...

Life passes so quickly. You shouldn't live in the same place. You shouldn't be too absorbed in your schedule of life.

But I have a schedule as well. For days and days, i would do some productive stuff. I would do some recreational stuff to feel happy.

And time goes on and life kinda flows itself.

Everything changes and I like that. It's always good if something changed, it changes for the better most times. And it usually adds meaning to your life, to see what is possible and what is not possible.

Find new meanings into what it is like to be alive, that's what change is.

Sometimes we all need little sanctuary where the wind can blow the trees around, and you can open your windows and sit down in your living room. All by yourself.

This is my life.
And I will make the most out of it.
And I will do the things I've always wanted to do.
Though I may not have enough time to do them.

But I don't do the things just because I want any results.
I want to spend my time pursuing and dreaming and spend my entire life on optimistic things.
The occasional hobby or the occasional meeting, the occasional friend, the occasional discovery, the occasional trip, the occasional holiday.

That would be my life. And you can really tell that no matter what happens, the most important thing is to see the best side of things. And to make sure that everything will always be alright, to love every moment. To appreciate how the world operates. To feel the emotions, no matter where you are, no matter when.
