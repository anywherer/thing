Trauma is not good.


Lots of events can cause feelings of anger and hurt.

And the sad thing is, they may never go away.

Whereas the best day of your life is an unforgettable day you placed at the very top of your shelves, your trauma is the demons you hide in your basement, as they threaten to break free at any moment. Obviously, trauma is long lasting and really hard to get rid of, and its mental effects are worse than bad.

But there are many ways of dealing with trauma. Don't you ever forget that.
