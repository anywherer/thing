tutanota. my trusted email provider.

on 2024-10-15, Tutanota made an important blog post about their future plans.

Tutanota has been rebranded as Tuta about a year ago, a move that seemed to happen for no reason, and its users didn't really understand why they changed their logo to some weird light switch.

Tutanota explains that the flick of a light switch is a metaphor for awareness of privacy and anonymity on the web - especially relating to email.
I suppose Tutanota wants to be the light switch that shines light into the darkness of data colelction, and stopping others from reading your emails.
A light switch symbolizes ease of use

Apparently, Tutanota has given a lot of thought into their rebranding, as they establish the background of their trademarks and stuff

The rebranding is in four steps: brand audit and analyzing the old brand, brand creation and making the new logo, brand development and extending the direction to brand assets and products, and brand implementation


as I suspected, this is a turning point for Tutanota. Quote, "Tuta's new product ecosystem has just begun..."

more products, sounds fun. I really hope you'll be able to offer nice products, but keep in mind that you should stay kind to everyone.

Tutanota is currently hiring for a bunch of positions, probably to do more planning and software development.


Tutanota offers its clients for Windoes, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, and browser. I appreciate the wide range of supported platforms, but we all know that their Github repositories always have way too many unresolved issues waiting to be fixed. We can only hope that these issues can be resolved soon and that they will add amazing features in the future.



It's easy to compare Tutanota to Proton. Proton really seems way more commercial. On the other hand, Tutanota is a small team that focuses on warm 
Not to say that Proton is untrustworthy, but it's easy to see how money-greedy they are through their constant attempts to get mroe customers

Tutanota is truly the best email provider out there. I always wondered to myself: 



Look, i knew they wanted to hire new people, and on 2024-11-04 they announced they have 7 people joining the team just as i thought. haha. go team!
