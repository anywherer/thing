> What is love? Baby don't hurt me...

Seriously, what is love? Neurology?

Despite centuries of obsession, it still overwhelms us to this day.

The word love simply tries to represent too many ideas. I honestly think it would be good if the word simply disappeared and we can stop using such a broad word.

It's what you feel towards someone or something that makes you happy.



if love is a thing we can define, how can it mean so many contradictory things? 








Robert Sternberg had [26 things about love](http://www.robertjsternberg.com/love). Each represent something that we associate with this one word. For example, love is often said to be an addiction, something that you want despite being harmful.

I have to mention though, "the courage to be happy" says that love is a promise that represents courage. Love is a feeling where you really respect someone. The notes I took on the book are misplaced though, I think I did notes on paper. I wish it wasn't like this.
